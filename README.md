# CSCI 544 Final Project
Attempted implementation of the paper "DR-BiLSTM: Dependent Reading Bidirectional LSTM for Natural Language Inference".



## Getting Started

Google Colab was used for preprocessing the dataset, training the model and testing.
To train the model, run the import statements in the beginning; go to the cell with train function and start from there. 
A pretrained model "best.pth.tar" is included. To test, run the last two cells.
